## ✨ About This Repository

This repository is like my **personal playground** for web development.  
It includes a variety of small projects from basic HTML pages to interactive JavaScript demos all organized neatly for learning, practice, and inspiration.

Each folder inside represents a **separate mini project**, complete with its own HTML, CSS, and JS files.  
Over time, I’ll keep adding more as I improve my skills in design and functionality 🚀

---

💡 *Each folder is an independent mini-project. Open `index` in your browser to view it.*
